<b>TL;DR Starting a new habit</b>

<br/>
Hello stranger, welcome to this little pocket of the internet!

Iâ€™ve been putting this off of a while but now itâ€™s finally time to create another <i>habit</i>.

Back in Covid-19 times, I started journaling and being more introspective. Life and memories prior has been a blur. Additionally, it was the first time for me to deal with ambiguity and realize how thereâ€™s no concrete roadmap or plan in life.

My north stars moving forward: <b>Resourcefulness - Adaptability - Creativity</b>


## Expectations / Motivation
- Ever since Iâ€™ve started making [pixel art][pixel-art-url], Iâ€™ve developed a habit of creating a new piece daily (1-4 hours). Though some days spill over to the next day due to life obligations. This blog will serve as another outlet for creativity and self expression.
- Most of my writing has been personal journal entries. Hopefully this serves as an outlet for me to share my thoughts on a more public medium rather than the confines of my journals. "Baby steps" as they say.
- Practice starting instead of pondering. No matter how scuffed or incomplete this is, it will get better.
