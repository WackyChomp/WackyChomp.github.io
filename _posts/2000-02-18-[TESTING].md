## Welcome

Hello and welcome to gibberish Land ong

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.


## Welcoming???
Often times, welcoming is rarely used. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit. Placeat, explicabo quae? Ut nihil quaerat odio saepe non fugit aliquid facere tempore illo voluptatem officia eligendi laborum, nulla adipisci velit? Quasi maxime nisi asperiores temporibus, praesentium eveniet error impedit, doloribus sit quaerat eligendi quo enim modi atque officiis laborum ab fuga, obcaecati ut. Quam fugit qui ab consequatur maiores rem quia rerum excepturi quae? Fugiat sed, vitae quaerat ab, modi animi itaque labore esse earum at et minima est excepturi dignissimos expedita, omnis non facilis officiis alias! Facere ut placeat impedit iusto odit quo assumenda alias esse doloremque. Dolorem, corrupti vitae!

## Delight

In the light of delight, one should not have any shred of pessimism. Such an attitude shift will nullify the intent of positive expression. As egregious drawn out the text above is, the goal is to illustrate the creative freedom that one has in manifesting their thoughts into written text :)

## Delightful Text
* That is the beauty of writing and why it is a common form of communication. Overall, text is:
1. Essentially the closest visual representation of our thoughts
2. A wonderful way to communicate asynchronously

* Text isn't necessarily the most effective form of communication due to:
1. Lack of discernible tone detection
2. Being inaccessible to those with visual impairments ðŸ™ˆ
